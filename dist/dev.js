  // src/cropping.ts
  //! Background info: For some unknown reason, Suno doesn't keep the data bout the original clip when you crop it.
  //! To work around this, whenever we find a cropped clip, we find the first clip that:
  //! - Is earlier than the cropped clip
  //! - Has the same genre as the cropped clip
  //! - Has the same image as the cropped clip
  //! This last part is especially tricky because Suno stores the images as URLs, and the URLs are different for the same image. Moreover, even the images themselves are different because they are compressed at different times, and as JPEG is a lossy format, the images are not pixel-perfect.
  //! (Imagine all the pains we have to go through just because someone (Suno team, I'm looking at you) didn't think it was important to keep the data about the original clip when cropping it!)
